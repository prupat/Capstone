Capstone Project: Assessing Job Vulnerability and Employment Growth in the Era of Large Language Models

Welcome to the repository for my capstone project titled "Assessing Job Vulnerability and Employment Growth in the Era of Large Language Models." This project explores the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence on job vulnerability and employment growth, particularly in white-collar occupations.


Project Overview:
- The project aims to analyze the likelihood of job automation across different occupations and states.
- It utilizes a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/occupation-salary-and-likelihood-of-automation) combining automation probability data with state-specific employment data.
- Interactive data visualization techniques are employed to present the findings in an accessible manner.

Dependencies:
- D3.js
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
